# Hospital-Readmission


Problem Statement:
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can identify patients who are at high risk of hospital readmission within 30 days after their initial discharge.

Business Use Cases:
Healthcare management: Identify who are the high-risk patients which need special care.

Approach:
1.	Data Preprocessing: This task involves cleaning and preparing the healthcare data. You'll need to handle missing values, perform data normalization or scaling, and deal with categorical variables.
2.	Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that can be used for predictive modeling. This may involve extracting patient demographics, medical history, previous hospitalizations, and other relevant information.
3.	Model Building: Develop a machine learning or statistical model that can predict the likelihood of hospital readmission within 30 days. Common approaches include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or more advanced models like gradient boosting or neural networks.
4.	Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the predictive model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).

Results: 
Interpretation of model predictions involves understanding which features contribute to the likelihood of hospital readmission. You can use techniques like feature importance analysis to identify key factors. 
Actionable recommendations can be made based on the insights gained from the model, such as targeted interventions for high-risk patients or improvements in care protocols.
